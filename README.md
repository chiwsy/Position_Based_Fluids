Introduction
=====================
* The first stage of this project has already been done with Beiling Lu and Lei Radium Yang. 
	* A serial version implemented the basic algorithms
	* New constraints for collision detection and interactivity
	* Surface reconstruction

	[Check the demo for stage 1](http://youtu.be/UF9xwl5-nlQ)
	
* In the second stage, I would like to perform the following tasks:
	* CUDA version of PBF
	* Accelerated algorithms in density estimation
	* Real-time surface reconstruction
