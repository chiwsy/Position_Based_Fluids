Introduction
=====================
* The first stage of this project has already been done with Beiling Lu and Lei Radium Yang. 
	* A serial version implemented the basic algorithms
	* New constraints for collision detection and interactivity
	* Surface reconstruction
* In the second stage, I would like to perform the following tasks:
	* CUDA version of PBF
	* Accelerated algorithms in density estimation
	* Real-time surface reconstruction
